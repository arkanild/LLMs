# OVERVIEW:

A utility to tailor your resumes based on a specific job description. It connects to an open-source LLM, takes your resume and the job description as inputs, and generates a tailored resume in DOC format. This allows users to efficiently apply to multiple job positions with resumes customized for each role.

Happy (Job) Hunting! ðŸŽ¯


# HOW DOES IT DO IT?

Upload Your Resume â€“ Provide your resume in PDF format.
Enter the Job Description â€“ Input the job description for the position you're applying for.
AI-Powered Customization â€“ The system processes both inputs and sends a structured prompt to an LLM available on Hugging Face.
Inference API â€“ Uses Hugging Faceâ€™s Inference API, requiring a token for authentication. Some models are gated and may need additional permissions, but you can switch models if you have the required access.
Customizable Parameters â€“ Through prompt engineering, you can adjust parameters such as temperature, max_new_tokens, etc., giving you flexibility similar to running a local model on PyTorch or TensorFlow.
